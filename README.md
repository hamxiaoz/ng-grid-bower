=============

ng-grid bower component

## Difference between `ng-grid` and `ng-grid-bower`

If you do `bower search ng-grid` you'll find both:
`ng-grid` and `ng-grid-bower`
The difference is:
- `ng-grid-bower` only contains the necessary files (js and css) so it's suited for production usage.
- `ng-grid`, upon installing it will install *all* the files (including build/src/test).
